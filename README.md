# Eventlite Frontend React App

This is an Eventbrite clone, built as part of [The Complete React on Rails course and book](https://learnetto.com/users/hrishio/courses/react-rails-course) on [Learnetto](https://learnetto.com) by Hrishi Mittal.

This app provides the frontend user interface for the [Eventlite Backend Rails API](https://github.com/learnetto/eventlite/tree/rails-api).

## How to run

First, install all the packages:

```
$ yarn
```

Start the Rails server (from the backend repository) on port 3000.

Then start this frontend app by running:

```
$ yarn start
```

Runs the app in the development mode on port 3001.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser.
